# bedrock-webpack ChangeLog

## 3.4.0 - 2020-03-24

### Added
- Command line options `--webpack-define NAME=VALUE` to define frontend data.
  In general, the frontend should use a pattern like the following:

```sh
node app.js --webpack-define MY_BOOL=true --wepack-define MY_JSON=false
```
```js
if(typeof MY_BOOL !== 'undefined' && MY_BOOL === 'true') {
  // ...
}
if(typeof MY_JSON !== 'undefined') {
  config.json = JSON.parse(MY_JSON);
}
```

### Changed
- `--webpack-symlink-watch <mode>` updated with new options:
  - `none`: Don't scan for symlinks..
  - `top`: Scan top-level `node_modules` directory (old `true` works).
  - `all`: Recursively scan for symlinks in `node_modules` directories`

## 3.3.0 - 2020-03-18

### Changed
- Only define `process.env.NODE_ENV` when `--webpack-mode production` is used.
  Allows use of frontend production only code.

## 3.2.0 - 2020-02-13

### Fixed
- Add root `node_modules` path last to modules search path to fix issue with
  symlinked modules.

## 3.1.0 - 2020-01-24

### Fixed
- Adjust webpack path processing so the root file is found early and regular
  `node_modules` processing takes default priority over the root
  `node_modules`. This helps avoid the issue of using the top-level version of
  a package when a local specific version should be used. Note that there still
  remains a potential similar issue of choosing the wrong version when using
  webpack config overrides. This is a specialized use case and will be
  addressed at a later time if needed.

### Changed
- Update dependencies.

## 3.0.2 - 2019-12-19

### Fixed
- Wrap and adjust HMR middleware to avoid disruption of proper session
  operation.

## 3.0.1 - 2019-11-12

### Changed
- Update dependencies.

### Added
- Add vue-template-compiler dependency.

## 3.0.0 - 2019-11-08

### Notes

- **BREAKING**: This is a major release. **Upgrading is required.** Read the
  changes below and those in `bedrock-views`.

### Fixed
- `--webpack-uglify-beautify` was setting incorrect flag.

### Changed
- Switched from async library to async/await.
- Use "watch" support by default for development.
- Use webpack "development" mode for built files.
- By default disable Babel during developmemt and enable during production.
- Enable Babel cache.
- **BREAKING**: Remove `bedrock-webpack.baseEntry` option in favor of a
  `bedrock-webpack.polyfillEntry` option. The default is to load a file that
  imports `@core-js/stable` and `regenerator-runtime/runtime` and uses the
  `entry` builtin mode of `@babel/preset-env`.
- **BREAKING**: Require Node.js >= 10.10. (Used for modern fs.promises and
  newer fs APIs).
- Switched from UglifyJS to Terser for JS minification.
- **BREAKING**: Changed around various minification option names. Check
  `--help`.
- Use core-js@3.

### Added
- eslint support.
- `--webpack-uglify-comments <true|false>` to omit all comments.
- `--webpack-mode <development|production>` to set webpack mode.
- `--webpack-stats <true|false>` to output stats.
- `--webpack-log-config <true|false>` to output webpack config.
- `--webpack-babel <true|false|mode>` to set babel mode.
- `--webpack-babel-debug <true|false>` to set babel debug mode.
- `--webpack-progress <true|false>` to show webpack progress.
- `--webpack-symlink-watch` option that, by default, will scan `node_modules`
  for symlinks and add webpack aliases so they work in watch mode. This is a
  limitation of the current webpack and will be removed once upstream
  supports symlink style development. This feature currently only scans the
  top-level of packages for symlinks.
- Initial "watch" support.
  - Used to rebuild optimized output as source files change.
  - Explicitly enabled with: `--minify true --watch true`.
  - Hot Module Replacement (HRM) support.
- `clean-webpack-plugin` support.
- CSS extraction support. Only enabled with CLI option due to a bug related
  to static imports.
- CSS optimization support.
- Handle image and font files.
- Clean build directory support.
